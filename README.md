## Vision
- To make all bioinformaticians and collaborators happy in single-cell study 

## Our Missions 
- To setup single-cell data workflow 
- To make synthetic single-cell data

## Strategies
1. each project with any good idea will be open to everybody
2. use issue and pull for question and participation  

## Projects
1. how to join using github project https://github.com/features/project-management/
1. our first mission, celltype identification https://github.com/hmgene/mudcookies/projects/1

## Some details
Single-cell RNA tools, best to my short knowledge, perform the following steps (standard-like tool names:  
1. cell counting (cellranger) 
1. normalization, reduction, (Seurat::SCTransform)  
1. integration, batch correction and reduction (Seurat::Integration, Harmony)   
1. interpretation and annotation (GSEA, GO, DESeq2, etc.)

We will develop independent programs handling a simple task.</br>
Using your data, test and validate assembled programs, and share your idea.
