# Vision
To help synthesize single-cell data for free for poor researchers.
I had some nice catch-phrases but forgot what they were.

# Missions 
The clear and greater goals will appear once we complete small goals.
## Learn and digest algorithms 
From my short experience the single-cell RNA tools perform the following steps:  
- cell counting (cellranger) 
- normalization, reduction, (Seurat::SCTransform)  
- integration, batch correction and reduction (Seurat::Integration, Harmony)   
- interpretation and annotation (GSEA, etc)

## Make the synthetic data indistinguishable  
We follow Bayesian concept :
- train a model using a real data
- regenerate data using the model 
- validate the performance
We will test whether people can tell which one is real.
