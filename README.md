# What is mudcookies
We help synthesize single-cell data for free for poor researchers.
I had some plan but forgot what they were.
I am looking for some volunteers.

## single-cell RNA tools
From my short experience the single-cell RNA tools perform the following steps:  
- cell counting (cellranger)
- normalization: lognormal, SCTransform, ..  

- integration and reduction   
- interpretation and annotation 

Many smart people provide great tools for us,
but it is hard to understand them all.
