## Our Vision 
  **To improve productivity at single-cell study**
  Single-cell data and analytic tools are growing, but finding the proper solutions is unlikely.
  This is because we don't have time to review each tool that deals with addressing the related biological questions.
  We propose a solution that maximize productivity by utilizing human-human interactions. 
  
  홑방 데이터와 분석 도구는 증가하지만 그게 옳은지 판단하기 힘듭니다.
  그것은 그 도구가 적절한지 판단할 시간과 관련 생물학적 지식과 통계 알고리즘에 대한 이해가 부족해서 입니다.
  이해의 주체는 인간이며, 인간 관계를 적절히 조합하여 최대의 효율과 성과를 얻을 수 있다고 생각합니다. 
    
## Our Missions 
- To find most significant tasks in single-cell analysis
- To let leaders guide a direction and followers implement ideas.

## Strategies
- record your efforts and machine and human readable
- human-teaching and muchine learning
