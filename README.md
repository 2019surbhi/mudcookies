</td><td> Single-cell data and running tools are expensive but essential for publication and funding. 
Can we do that with virtual data?

## Progress 
- [x] : scPred track 
- [x] : harmony track
- [ ] : immune track

## Our Vision
- To provide virtual single-cell data with one click

## Our Missions 
- To make pipelines for single-cell data analysis
- To make synthetic data 

## Strategies
1. make a project for each goal 
1. use issue and pull for making project tasks
1. keep monitoring hot issues:

| issues | tools   | description |
| :-: | :-:  | :-: |
| celltype identification | https://github.com/powellgenomicslab/scPred/ | celltype trainer |
| celltype identification | https://github.com/icbi-lab/scirpy | TCR analyzer  |
