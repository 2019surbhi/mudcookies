  **To prove usefulness of sythetic single-cell data**
  Single-cell data and the required systems are expensive, but essential for publishing and financing your research. 
  We start a small project to spread positivity and enthusiasm in single-cell research.  
  
## Our Missions 
- To make synthetic data useful  
- To build teamwork

## Strategies
- To build human-machine pairs (crowed-computation)
- To build human-human pairs (menthor-mentee)
- To share benefits (githup contributions)
- To focus on hot issues: mentors lead mentees implement
